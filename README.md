# -Overlapping-1011-Sequence-Detector---Moore-FSM
Sequence detection is a fundamental operation in digital communication systems, protocol analyzers, and pattern recognition circuits. This project implements a Moore Finite State Machine to detect the specific binary pattern "1011" with two operational modes:
